# Regression Analysis: Modeling Height Based on Weight Data

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using Python. The project uses height and weight data to predict heights based on weights.

## Project Structure

- `simple-linear-regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the linear regression analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
- `height-weight.csv`: Dataset containing height and weight data used for the regression analysis.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook simple-linear-regression.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to see the linear regression analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset `height-weight.csv` contains the following columns:
- `Height`: Height of individuals in cm.
- `Weight`: Weight of individuals in Kg.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn.
3. **Preprocessing**: Standardization of the model and preparation of the data for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Perform simple linear regression using scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Use the model to predict height based on new weights values.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries, as specified in `requirements.txt`:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the command mentioned in the Installation section.
